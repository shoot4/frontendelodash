# Managed Game Boosting Platform Frontend Development Roadmap

## Introduction
This roadmap outlines the steps to develop the frontend of a Managed Game Boosting Platform using NextJS, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and modern UI/UX frameworks. We will use [Boosting Market's Marvel Rivals page](https://boostingmarket.com/pt/marvel-rivals-boost) as a reference for both layout and visual design. Treat this reference site as a wireframe to guide the organization of elements like menus, buttons, sections, and main flows, while adopting its visual style. Note that we will exclude certain elements such as the language selector and game categories, as our initial focus is solely on Marvel Rivals.

## Phase 1: Planning and Design

### Reference Site Analysis
- Analyze the layout and visual design of the reference site: [Boosting Market's Marvel Rivals page](https://boostingmarket.com/pt/marvel-rivals-boost).
- Identify key elements such as menus, buttons, sections, and main flows to replicate, excluding the language selector and game categories.

### UI/UX Design
- *Color Palette Definition:*
  - Use #F44322 as the primary color (logo color).
  - Implement a dark background theme with complementary colors.
- *Typography Definition:*
  - Choose a clean, modern font similar to the reference site. Consider using Google Fonts like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for readability and style consistency.

## Phase 2: Setup and Configuration

### Project Setup
- Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support.
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.

### Component Library
- Develop a reusable component library using NextJS and TailwindCSS.
- Ensure components align with the design and layout of the reference site.

## Phase 3: Core Frontend Development

### Core Components
- *Header:*
  - Implement logo, navigation menu, and authentication buttons (Login/Register). Exclude the language selector.

- *Hero Section:*
  - Develop a Marvel Rivals-specific banner with title, description, and call-to-action buttons.

- *Boosting Services Grid:*
  - Create service cards for Marvel Rivals with service title, key features list, image, "Buy Now" button, and status indicator (New/Popular).

- *Footer:*
  - Design a footer with social media links, legal links, and payment methods. Exclude game categories.

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the platform is fully responsive across devices.
- Utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout management.

## Phase 4: Backend Integration Planning

### API Design and Mocking
- Design the API endpoints needed for frontend functionality.
- Use tools like Postman or Swagger to mock API responses.

### Authentication and Authorization Planning
- Plan user authentication and authorization flows.
- Consider backend implementation for security.

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing

### API Integration
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs using Axios or Fetch API.

### Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest and NextJS Testing Library.
- Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress.

## Phase 6: Optimization and Deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize images and assets for faster load times.
- Implement lazy loading and code splitting.

### SEO and Accessibility
- Ensure SEO best practices and implement accessibility standards (WCAG).

### Deployment
- Deploy the application using Vercel or Netlify.
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Phase 7: Maintenance and Iteration

### User Feedback and Iteration
- Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
- Continuously iterate on features and design.

### Bug Fixes and Updates
- Regularly update dependencies and fix bugs.
- Monitor application performance and user analytics.

## Misc:
- The Marvel Rivals ranking system must be used consistently throughout the Managed Game Boosting Platform:
  - Bronze III to Bronze I
  - Silver III to Silver I
  - Gold III to Gold I
  - Platinum III to Platinum I
  - Diamond III to Diamond I
  - Grandmaster III to Grandmaster I
  - Celestial III to Celestial I
  - Eternity
  - One Above All
